Oliphant is a library that uses change notifications from database servers to improve the management of objects via the Hibernate Java ORM.

Change notifications allow the library to detect stale objects before they are sent back to the database, and to remove them from the L2 cache.

Oliphant is still a proof of concept. It works with PostgreSQL using a C function that sends notifications to Oliphant via a file. We are working on a patch to PostgreSQL that would allow arbitrary payloads in PostgreSQL notifications, meaning Oliphant could work with native PostgreSQL notifications.
