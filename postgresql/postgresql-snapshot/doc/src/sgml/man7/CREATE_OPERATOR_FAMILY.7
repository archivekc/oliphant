.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
CREATE OPERATOR FAMILY
creates a new operator family\&. An operator family defines a collection of related operator classes, and perhaps some additional operators and support functions that are compatible with these operator classes but not essential for the functioning of any individual index\&. (Operators and functions that are essential to indexes should be grouped within the relevant operator class, rather than being
\(lqloose\(rq
in the operator family\&. Typically, single\-data\-type operators are bound to operator classes, while cross\-data\-type operators can be loose in an operator family containing operator classes for both data types\&.)
.PP
The new operator family is initially empty\&. It should be populated by issuing subsequent
CREATE OPERATOR CLASS
commands to add contained operator classes, and optionally
ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY
commands to add
\(lqloose\(rq
operators and their corresponding support functions\&.
.PP
If a schema name is given then the operator family is created in the specified schema\&. Otherwise it is created in the current schema\&. Two operator families in the same schema can have the same name only if they are for different index methods\&.
.PP
The user who defines an operator family becomes its owner\&. Presently, the creating user must be a superuser\&. (This restriction is made because an erroneous operator family definition could confuse or even crash the server\&.)

Refer to
Section 34.14, \(lqInterfacing Extensions To Indexes\(rq, in the documentation
for further information\&.
