.nf
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY [ IF EXISTS ] \fIname\fR USING \fIindex_method\fR [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY
drops an existing operator family\&. To execute this command you must be the owner of the operator family\&.
.PP
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY
includes dropping any operator classes contained in the family, but it does not drop any of the operators or functions referenced by the family\&. If there are any indexes depending on operator classes within the family, you will need to specify
CASCADE
for the drop to complete\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
IF EXISTS
.RS 4
Do not throw an error if the operator family does not exist\&. A notice is issued in this case\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIname\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fIindex_method\fR

.RE
.PP
CASCADE
.RS 4

.RE

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Remove the B\-tree operator family
float_ops:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY float_ops USING btree;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that use operator classes within the family\&. Add
CASCADE
to drop such indexes along with the operator family\&.

statement in the SQL standard\&.
