.SH "NAME"
START_TRANSACTION \- start a transaction block
.\" START TRANSACTION
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
START TRANSACTION [ \fItransaction_mode\fR [, \&.\&.\&.] ]

where \fItransaction_mode\fR is one of:

    ISOLATION LEVEL { SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ UNCOMMITTED }
    READ WRITE | READ ONLY
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command begins a new transaction block\&. If the isolation level or read/write mode is specified, the new transaction has those characteristics, as if
SET TRANSACTION
was executed\&. This is the same as the
BEGIN
command\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Refer to
SET TRANSACTION
for information on the meaning of the parameters to this statement\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
In the standard, it is not necessary to issue
START TRANSACTION
to start a transaction block: any SQL command implicitly begins a block\&.
PostgreSQL\(aqs behavior can be seen as implicitly issuing a
COMMIT
after each command that does not follow
START TRANSACTION
(or
BEGIN), and it is therefore often called
\(lqautocommit\(rq\&. Other relational database systems might offer an autocommit feature as a convenience\&.
.PP
The SQL standard requires commas between successive
\fItransaction_modes\fR, but for historical reasons
PostgreSQL
allows the commas to be omitted\&.
.PP
See also the compatibility section of
SET TRANSACTION\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION
